			"QuestionUnder_GrowthHECMLoan":"I was told that my loan might \u201Cgrow.\u201D What does that mean?",
			"Answer_GrowthHECMLoan":"Depending on the type of reverse mortgage you received, you may experience \u201Cloan growth\u201D on your reverse mortgage. This \u201Cgrowth\u201D is simply an increase in the amount of money that you are eligible to advance, if you elected to have a line of credit as part of your payment plan option.\r\nIn order to simplify this concept, \u201Cgrowth\u201D is sometimes explained incorrectly to reverse mortgage borrowers as being similar to earning interest on a bank account.\r\nPlease know that your reverse mortgage is not a bank account and does not earn interest.\r\nThe \u201Cgrowth\u201D is simply additional credit that you may receive as time goes on with your reverse mortgage. Not all reverse mortgage loans have this growth. Those that do, typically experience growth in the available funds in their line of credit approximately equal to the current interest rate. However, because changing interest rates affect the level of growth, it is impossible to know what level of growth your reverse mortgage may or may not have over the life of your loan.",
